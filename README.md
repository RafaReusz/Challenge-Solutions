### Requirements
If you want to start solving these kind of challenges, I recommend you to start learning a programming language (preferably C++ in my vision) or Python (like I did) because it is more
user-friendly.
<br />
[C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&t=2784s).<br />
[Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw).<br />
[Aditional about competitive programming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBr_Fu6q9iHYQCh13jmpbrg).
<br />
### Purpose
As I am a suspicious person to talk, because I love it, challenges for me are pleasant... When I am taking a shower or almost sleeping or doing something randomic the answers sometimes
appear and many ways of solving old problems or the one which I am stuck. Problems that seem easy/trivial can make a big mess... and almost most part of the times, for the experts, never underestimate a question.
